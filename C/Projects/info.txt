ex01 = sort_012_array
Given an array consisting only 0's, 1's and 2's. Give an algorithm for sorting the array in O(n) time complexity ( in the sorted array, 0's will be at starting ,then the 1's & then the 2's).

ex02 = is_anagram
Given two strings, check whether two given strings are anagrams of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains same characters, only the order of characters can be different.
